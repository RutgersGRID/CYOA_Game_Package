0,Feeling like a burden,I’ve been so overwhelmed and exhausted lately and today it got the best of me. I was hit by a bike and needed to go to the ER. Facu told me I need to be more responsible and that I was starting to need too much from him.,,Am I in the wrong here? It feels like everyone is mad at me, yet I’m theone in the hospital bed. Should I even bother to call Facu next time I need something.
